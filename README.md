GigaQuery - Because Size Matters
================================

You've probably heard how 'micro-frameworks' and 'micro-libraries' are
cool. Well, that shit's mainstream. Want to be un the cutting edge?
`git clone` bitches. `git clone`. 

How do I Giga?
--------------

Just clone the repo and run the make utility. `make` all by itself will
give you `gigaquery.js`, `gigaquery.css` and the images folder all
located in the `dist` folder. `make
clean` will, you guessed it, remove the `dist` folder.

But what is it?
---------------

Its everything you could ever want. jQuery? duh. jQuery UI? of course!
tmpl, underscore, backbone? yuppers! A shit load of other stuff?
eventually. Pretty soon, instead of just trying to find that right
plugin, you can just try random functions!

Wait a minute, wont this be big?
--------------------------------

Yup! It'll be HUGE! And when people bitch about latency or speed, you
can boast that your javascript library is the biggest of them all. Lets
just say this lib knows how to please a browser.

This is a joke, right?
----------------------

Is it? IS IT?
